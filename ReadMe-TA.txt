Tourist Assistant

The system designed to help people create a plan for their trip.
It should save energy and time by listing different kind of choices for the user so he\she can choose from.
At the end of the program, the display function will print the whole plan for the user based on the choices he made.
I used different types of data as an input (string, integer and float), 
and I created multiple functions that takes parameters and returns outputs, not to mention the number of conditions and loops I used in this project.
Last but not least I thought about using Lambda function to show the expected budget for the plan.


Here is a summry for the code that matches the project requirements:

Input:(str destination, int number of travelers, int number of days, float the amount of budget)
Lists:(2 lists for each city, one for the hotels, the other for the activities) based on 3 destinations
Loops: For, While
functions:
(1-Function to help the user to choose the hotel
2-Function to help the user to choose the daily activities, returns dictionary with two keys(days, the activity)
3-Function that calculates the expected budget of the designed plan using Lambda
4-Function to display the plan)
